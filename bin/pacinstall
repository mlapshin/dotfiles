pacinstall 0.2 by Andreas Textor
Resembles checkinstall, for Arch Linux (http://archlinux.org/)

Just call pacinstall instead of "make install" when installing
software from source. An arch package will be created and installed
using pacman.

You need to have installwatch installed, download it here:
http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/installwatch.html
or get it from AUR:
http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=1145
